# Real-time chatroom
I developed a Real-time Chat Application, a robust platform designed for secure and instantaneous communication. Leveraging technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and WebSocket (Socket.io), this application boasts several key features. Users can enjoy secure access through personalized usernames, create or join different chat rooms for organized discussions, engage in real-time messaging, and seamlessly share multimedia files during conversations.

To run the application locally, follow these steps: clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-chat-app.git), navigate to the project directory (cd real-time-chat-app), install dependencies (npm install), start the server (node server.js), and open the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

The user experience involves logging in with a chosen username, exploring and joining existing chat rooms, or creating a new one. The real-time messaging functionality allows users to engage in instant conversations within the selected chat room.

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to the project!
